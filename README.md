# Biotech Data Analysis Demo

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a simple biotech-related data analysis workflow
implemented from a software engineering perspective.

The project focuses on how structured biological or clinical data can be
processed, cleaned, and analysed using reproducible Python code.

## What This Project Does
- Load and validate structured biological / clinical data
- Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing
- Generate summary statistics and exploratory visualisations
- Organise analysis logic in a clear and maintainable way

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Purpose
This project was created to demonstrate programming, data handling,
and version control skills relevant to data-driven biotech
and analytics platforms.
